# ImageCaptioningGenerator

This notebook is dedicated to exploring the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image captioning on a small dataset. Image captioning is a fascinating task that combines computer vision and natural language processing to generate meaningful textual descriptions based on visual content. The primary aim is to provide a detailed guide for individuals interested in constructing and comprehending LSTM models and CNN models. This step-by-step tutorial elucidates the process of building a model based on LSTM and CNN for image captioning tasks.
